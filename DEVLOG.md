# Development Log — Tales of Dream and Fantasy 2

## 2026-09-16
- Setup: Added `## Development Workflow` section to `CLAUDE.md` — establishes dev branch strategy, compile/smoke-test steps, and doc-update rules
- Setup: Created `DEVLOG.md`
- Fixed: `changeRelationship()` NPE (`Character.java:1366,1369`) — null-checked `currentQuest` before access and corrected boolean OR logic (stream result was being overwritten instead of combined)
- Cleaned: Removed 5 unguarded `System.out.println` debug calls from `changeRelationship()` (`Character.java`)
- Fixed: `spotQuests()` always returned 0 (`Character.java:944`) — changed `return 0` to `return questSuccess`; spot quests now correctly re-enter the priority queue on success (non-oneTime) or get removed (oneTime)
